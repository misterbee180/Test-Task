Right now, every task generates a time, regardless of whether there are any time details associated to it or not. As such the task instance generation wasn't fired because it would check whether evaluation was necessary for the time details, realize there is no repeating details associated with it and fail. So I think right now I have two options. 1) I don't provide a time id in the case where no time is provided. This would work extremely well for scenarios where there is legitmately no time details available. However in the circumstances where there is a future date associated with a task, the task needs to not create an instance now and create one later. So it seems to me that I should just evaluate the task, regardless of whether or not there are repeating details.

Where this becomes a problem though is if there are a ton of tasks. At this point it's going to become annoying that it has to process through every single task every single time. While it makes sense to process through records with time details associated with it, it really doesn't make sense to process through everything.

So I think this will be a few parts to this change.
- Set up a boolean that signifies that a task instance should be created automatically. I guess right now I have the one off session boolean so maybe I can just use that or I could just make a new one that seperates it a bit from that but effectively results in the same thing. Ultimately the difference between these two booleans is that one derives it's details from a session while the other doesn't. This will need to go on the task database table so that the boolean is queriable.
- We then need to update the evaluation function to look at records that don't have any repeating details but might have a date associated with it.
- Finally we need to re-work the way that tasks associated with sessions are evaluated. Instead of evaluating the individual tasks I think it makes more sense to evaluate the sessions, determine what sessions are good and then per session, find the tasks that are associated with those sessions, and then generate instances for those tasks.

Decided instead to just make it churn through all the apps. When we start getting crazy I'll look into this re-vamp.
