How do i monitize test task?
General advertisements
Simply display advertisements on bottom of screen

Targeted advertisements
Using key words I can have various adds displayed when more appropriate. Birthdays for instance could offer gift suggestions

Feemeium content
I can provide only limited functionality. Enough to interest a buyer but not enough to be slightly annoying.
Ideas:
1) Only show 1 of many upcoming tasks
2) Only allow for 1 session to be created
3) Only allow for X repeating tasks to exist at once
4) Limit long term item list to X items
5) Limit long term items
6) Limit to only 1 group
7) Limit to how many items can be associated w/ a group

Offer the app for free for 2 months. The problem w/ this approach is the limiting of elements after becomes very tough. How would this limiting occur? Maybe something to implement after a userbase is established.
