rest / soap
rest = representational state transfer (of an object). Sent using JSON or XML
rest - process of getting data from some web service (accessing web service)
api - how you access / connect to a server

java 
1. client requests data
2. servlet provides data back
3. data returned in XML / JSON (this is because data should have a standard logical structure)
