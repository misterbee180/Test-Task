So where do I need to go from here?

I have an app. Probably just need to build at least one more.

TODO: Buld another app
TODO: Figure out what app to build

What does your app do? 
- Logic w/ a database backend

What more could you add
- Server based storage
- Authentication Consuming REST / SOAP...
- Advertisement inclusion
- iOS development
- full app store publishing
- Push notifications
- User interface design
- Material Design
- Threading and memory management

The prior items are found under comming requests in android programming jobs. The goal is to incorporate them into the design of testtask so that the application is better and so that you can add it to your resume.

The plan will be to generate simple stand alone versions of the concepts and then include them into the system.
