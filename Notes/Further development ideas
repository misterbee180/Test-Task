So where do I need to go from here?

I have an app. Probably just need to build at least one more.

TODO: Buld another app
TODO: Figure out what app to build

What does your app do? 
- Logic w/ a database backend

What more could you add
- Server based storage
- Consuming REST / SOAP
- Advertisement inclusion
- iOS development
- full app store publishing
- User Experience design / Material Design
- Push notifications / Reoccurring polling 
- Threading and memory management
- Kotlin experience 

The prior items are found under comming requests in android programming jobs. The goal is to incorporate them into the design of testtask so that the application is better and so that you can add it to your resume.

The plan will be to generate simple stand alone versions of the concepts and then include them into the system.

Consuming REST / SOAP
- This involves using REST APIs to either get post update or delete data on a server

Published APP
- My current plan is to fix the to button and then to publish the app to the market.
