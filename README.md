# Test-Task
Test task is my flagship program. It's intended to replace calendar apps as your main source of daily task completion. The goal of this program is to organize your tasks into priority queues and display different tasks as priorities through out the day depending on when the task was set to be a priority. The expectation is that you don't need to get to a task now, but you should eventually get to the task and when it's a priority is the ideal time to do so. But, if you can't or don't when it's a priority the task remains avaialble to be completed without requiring you to finish it before moving onto other things by moving to a "today" queue and then later to a "standard" queue. The tool offers many features to help make organizing tasks for your day less tedious than a standard calendar app as well as many features unique to it like events, long term task management, and groups.
